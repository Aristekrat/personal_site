                    <h2>Happy to Move</h2>
                    <p>I am not tied down by kids, a house, or a lease. Once I find the right job, I intend to move right next door to my employer. Thus, you do not need to worry about distance.</p>

                    <h2>Why I Am Tired of Freelancing</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Freelancing is lonely. I am looking forward to being in a true team environment where I can colloborate with and learn from others.</li>
                            <li>I would like a house someday soon, but getting a home loan with a variable income is an uphill battle.</li>
                            <li>Ethos builds websites for attorneys. To get business, I have to go network with attorneys, and they can be an intensely boring bunch. I would be happy to stick to code.</li>

                    <h2>Looking to Settle Down</h2>
                    <p>So far, my tech career has consisted entirely of start ups, but at this point I am looking forward to the relative calm of a normal job. I hope to find an employer that I'll be happily working for tomorrow and ten years from now.</p>
