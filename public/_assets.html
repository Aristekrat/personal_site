                    <h2>Proven Ability to Learn</h2>
                    <p>The most compelling reason you should hire me is my proven ability to rapidly learn new skills. The huge tech cloud in my resume actually understates the breadth of my skills. I have extensively studied both web and mobile usability principles. I have studied the principles of design, including color theory, font choice, use of space, how to draw focus, and how to properly use contrast. I've studied SEO extensively. I've launced PPC campaigns. I've done A/B tests. I've done in person user testing. I have studied copywriting. I've managed teams.</p>

                    <p>I started my tech career just three years ago.</p>

                    <p>Before that, I graduated from law school and passed the bar. After the bar, I got a job examining incredibly complex financial documents.</p>

                    <p>My ability to rapidly absorb information is undeniable. That makes me a great investment for your organization. My value to you is just going to keep growing every year. This is particularly true because...</p>

                    <h2>Code is my One True Love</h2>
                    <p>It took me much longer than I would have liked to find what I want to do with my life, but this is it. Code is beautiful. I want to be a developer until the day I retire.</p>

                    <p>Because I enjoy doing it, everything else is easier. Long hours are not so hard, devoting myself to improvement is never a burden, and I don't have to struggle to focus. Naturally, it is easier to put in long hours and devote myself to programming because I enjoy it so much.</p>

                    <h2>Versatility</h2>
                    <p>I have broad skills, but the requirements for your position are likely narrow, and you don't have an immediate need for all of my skills. However, surprises come up in business. At some point in the future, it is entirely possible that you will have to confront challenges you could not have anticipated. When that happens, it is nice to know you have someone who can tackle whatever problems come.</p>
